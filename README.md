# Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm a senior .NET full stack developer. I'm employed by [DVT](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dvt/mycompany/) and placed on projects at various clients across the globe.  Because of this, I get exposure to different technologies and the intricacies of how those are implemented at any specific client.  I have been a developer for more than thirty years.
- 👨‍💻 I love writing code and I shy away from having to tell others what to do.  I was "promoted" to project manager in my late twenties and I really did not enjoy it.  It took me away from writing code and I had to check on others' work and make sure everyone stayed in line.  Laurence, J Peter was correct when he said that in any hierarchy, many people get promoted to their level of incompetence.
- 🌱 I'm working towards various cloud certifications for Azure & AWS. 
- 💬 Ask me about MS SQL, data migration, .NET with C#, MVC, ASP.NET, PostgreSQL, Machine Learning, JavaScript, algorithms/coding patterns and getting older...
- I'm currently working on a machine learning project that is training a model to make accurate suggestions on the amount of effort required to implement a design as is contained in a Figma Design Document.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My Zen place is where I go while cleaning my house 🧼🧽🧹  There is something very soothing about mopping floors, washing dishes, and getting rid of clutter - I guess it's like "wax on, wax off..."
