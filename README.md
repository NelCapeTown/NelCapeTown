# Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm a contractor, employed by [DVT](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dvt/mycompany/) and placed on projects at various clients.  Because of this, I get exposure to different technologies and the intricacies of how those are implemented at any specific client.  I have been a developer for more than thirty years.
- 👨‍💻 I love writing code and I shy away from having to tell others what to do.  I was "promoted" to project manager in my late twenties and I really did not enjoy it.  It took me away from writing code and I had to check on others' work and make sure everyone stayed in line.  I understand very well what the Peter Principle is.
- 🌱 I'm working towards various cloud certifications for Azure & AWS. 
- 💬 Ask me about MS SQL, .NET with C#, MVC, ASP.NET, JavaScript, algorithms/coding patterns and getting older...
- 📫 How to reach me: <a href="mailto:nel@nelcapetown.com">nel@nelcapetown.com</a>
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My Zen place is where I go while cleaning my house 🧼🧽🧹  There is something very soothing about mopping floors, washing dishes, and getting rid of clutter - I guess it's like "wax on, wax off..."
